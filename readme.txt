This plugin works in concert with the FeedWordPress plugin to enhance syndication of content from Mediacore sites. It creates the necessary code to embed the video for each item in the feed in the resulting post. 

== Description ==

This plugin works as an AddOn to [FeedWordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedwordpress/) to ehnance the syndication of content from [Mediacore](http://www.mediacore.com) sites. The plugin modifies the incoming syndicated content so that the videos associated with each Mediacore feed item become embedded within the resulting WordPress post. It also allows you to determine if you want the categories used by Mediacore to be turned into tags on the resulting WordPress posts. 

== Installation ==


1. Upload the contents of the directory 'mediacore-ingest' to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Mediacore Ingest and enter the URL of your Mediacore installation (the plugin uses this URl to filter out syndicated content from non-Mediacore sites). You may also check the box to turn Mediacore categories into tags on the resulting WordPress posts.
